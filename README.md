# NSS Exercise: JS Intro to For Loops

### Description:
> Have students do 4 different challenges that makes them start at different initial values, use different evaluation punctuation (>, <, <=, >=), and increment/decrement the counter by different amounts.

> * Write a for loop that increments the counter variable by 10 each time, and displays the value.
> * Write a for loop that divides the counter variable by 2 each time, and displays the value.
> * Augment the loop to insert each new value into an array
> * Write a loop that starts at 100 and decrements a variable by 1. If the number is even, add the number to the beginning of an array, else add it to the end of the array.



### Final Result:
> Deepened my understanding of the for-loop counter
